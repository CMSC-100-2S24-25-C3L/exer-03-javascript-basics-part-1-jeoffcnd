EXERCISE #3

This is, in my opinion, the most bearable exercise in my current courses. I have discovered that, even though each exercise is challenging and I worry about not finishing and becoming stuck in class, the most crucial thing is to trust what you have learned and to trust yourself. I have discovered that, if I try to study the upcoming topics (and their fundamental concepts), I will be able to somehow gain a foundation and background knowledge in what the exercise will be and how I can code it. I believe that as time goes on, my fear of my laptop's keyboards is decreasing. For this reason, making an effort at each lab meeting truly aids in my ability to code, such as javascript, which is our task today.
